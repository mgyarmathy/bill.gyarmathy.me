<p>Williams Space Odyssey is the pin that really hooked
me as a kid growing up.&nbsp; There's no telling how much money I pumped into this machine.  I often played
it in the "Games People Play" arcade at the Houston, Texas Memorial City Mall. This
arcade always had at least 20 pins in a row just waiting for my quarters.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<P>

This was my first pin restoration project.&nbsp; After searching for a while I
was fortunate to find a Williams Space Odyssey from a fellow pin
collector.&nbsp; I was excited because I hadn't seen the machine in some 20
years and it was the pin that started it all for me.&nbsp; I didn't really know how much it worked, but all the pieces where there and I was ready to dive in and have some fun.  
I worked on it
off and on for about 7 months.  It's very satisfying taking an old
pin that isn't working and breathing new life into it.  The biggest rush of excitement is the
first time you 
turn it on and see how your efforts have (hopefully) paid off.&nbsp; My kids and
I really like playing the &quot;new&quot; old pin and it's fun to remember the
nostalgia of days gone by.<P>

I've been hooked on playing pinball since I was young, but I have to say I'm totally hooked on 
fixing/restoring/repairing pinball machines.  I'm ready to quit my day job, but unfortunately have many more years 
before retirement :-(. I started out with my first pin, a Williams Grand Prix,
and my collection has now grown to 6 machines in just about a year.&nbsp;  Needless to say, I'm hooked - you can't just have one pin.  The hobby is
great fun and it's always challenging to come up with creative ways to
&quot;hide&quot; another pin in the house from my wife :-).<P>

I have to thank <a href="mailto:cfh@provide.net">cfh</a> for his excellent pin how-to and restoration guides.
Without his work I often wouldn't have known where to start restoring something and/or fixing a
problem.&nbsp; His guides definitely help to boost your confidence.  The rec.games.pinball newsgroup
has also been a tremendous help.  There's really never a dumb question, just the question that
is not asked.&nbsp; In the spirit of the group, I have tried to help others when possible.<P>

Below are some resources that I used through out the project.

   <tr>
      <td width="50%" valign="top">This is a picture of the playfield before the fun begins.  The picture is a bit 
          dark, but you can see the initial efforts of Novus 2 just above the special light 
          by the left outlane.  The playfield is in pretty good shape with some light worn
          spots by the left flipper.  For its age, the paint was in good shape, but some areas had paint
          lifting and the infamous ball swirl arcs.  A number of playfield
          insert lamps had also sunk below the playfield surface.<P>

          To clean the playfield, I first removed everything (posts, plastics, etc.) so it was completely
          flat.  Initially, I tried Novus 3 followed by Novus 2, but I didn't like the results.  
          The Novus 3 was
          held in the small divots of the playfield and you could see white specs where it
          was used.  In the end, I just cleaned the playfield with Novus 2 and followed up
          with a number of Johnson's paste wax applications.  <P>
          I used the "hot wax" treatment
          with the Johnson's paste wax with great results.  Basically, apply the wax and then
          use a hair dryer on the warm/hot setting to get the wax to dry.  Removing the wax
          is a chore, but after a couple of times, you'll have protected the playfield nicely.<P>
          
          All the playfield plastics were really dirty, but cleaned up just fine with Novus 2.<P>

   <tr>
      <td width="50%">Here's another before picture of the upper playfield and ball arch.  
          The upper ball arch and shooter lane did have a worn ball groove.  Initially, I had 
          <B>planned</B> on just lightly sanding the ball groove and build up a
        couple of coats of lacquer, but I just didn't like the results.&nbsp; So I ended up doing the following:<A>
          <UL> 
             <LI> use Novus 3 to clean out ball groove that held ground in black
             <LI> sand down the ball groove edges using 400/800 grit sand paper.&nbsp;
              get nice clean wood showing.
             <LI> clean sanded area with Naptha.&nbsp; use one cotton cloth to
              apply and quickly wipe off with another cotton cloth.
             <LI> because the playfield is totally stripped, I taped off the
              shooter lane and upper ball arch where the painted and clear areas
              meet.&nbsp; I then sprayed a couple of coats of lacquer.
             <LI> blend in built up lacquer with surrounding areas using 800/1200/2000 grit sand paper
             <LI> polish with Novus 2 and follow with a couple of coats of Johnson's wax</a>
          </UL>

<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="6" border="0" bordercolorlight="#000000" bordercolordark="#0000FF" width="100%">
    <td width="907" valign="top">To get the lacquer to feather in with the rest of the playfield, I
      &quot;back taped&quot; the area being sprayed.&nbsp; What you do is put
      the long edge of the tape down and pull it back the top edge so it gently
      curves backward (sticky side is now up).&nbsp; This helps to get a
      light/smooth coat of lacquer at the edges being sprayed.&nbsp; I would
      attach newspaper to the sticky tape edge and protect the rest of the
      playfield from over spray.<p>I don't have
        a close up picture of the finished results, but overall, I'm real pleased
        with the results.&nbsp; In a small area I had a problem with the lacquer
laying down which produced dreaded &quot;fish eyes&quot;.&nbsp; To solve this, I cleaned the area well
      with Naptha and then shot another coat of lacquer.&nbsp In the future, I'll think
      twice about removing the ball groove from the shooter lane and upper arch.&nbsp It just took
      too long to get it just right and, besides, it's part of the machine's character.<p>

   <tr>
      <td width="50%" valign="top">A buffing wheel has to be one of the most valuable tools for cleaning
        up metal parts.&nbsp; I used a bench grinder and put a fine wire wheel
        on the left side and two sewed cloth buffing wheels on the right.&nbsp;
        The wire wheel is great for knocking off the rust and other crud and the
        buffing wheel with some white rouge buffing compound gets the metal
        polished shiny in no time.
        <p>Initially I had the bench grinder in the garage, but it was making
        quite a mess with dust flying everywhere.&nbsp; So, I mounted it on a
        1x6 and then attached to my Black and Decker Workmate.&nbsp; Now it's
        portable and it's easy to break down and store when finished.</p>
        <p>One thing about safety.&nbsp; Be sure to wear eye protection when
        using a setup like this.&nbsp; I also use work gloves when holding larger pieces and vise grips for smaller items (playfield posts,
        etc.).&nbsp; It's important to use good eye protection and gloves because
        metal parts can get ripped out of your hands if you're not careful.

<table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%" valign="top">I built a support box for the playfield so I could work on
      it outside of the cabinet.&nbsp; It was handy to move the playfield and
      its support box to my workbench.&nbsp; This way I wasn't always leaning over into the
      cabinet.&nbsp; On days it was just too hot in the garage, I would bring it
      inside and lay it on the kitchen table - don't you know my wife loved
      that!
      <p>The inside box dimensions are just an 1/8&quot; bigger than the
      playfield size.&nbsp; I used 1x4's for all pieces, except for 1x2's for
      the playfield support rails (shown shorter than the length of box).&nbsp; I
      also reduced the 1x2's thickness just a bit so that all items (lamp sockets,
      etc.) under the playfield would have room.&nbsp; The height of the box is
      9&quot; to allow for stepper/bonus units under the playfield.&nbsp; All
      pieces were assembled using sheet rock screws and wood glue.</p>
      <p>Initially I planned to make the support box out of 1x8's and make a
      true open top box, but I had some scrap 1x4's and decided to use them
      instead.&nbsp; It was a lucky decision, because using the
      1x4's allowed side openings.  The playfield top and bottom could be accessed at the same
      time.  This worked great when removing playfield inserts.</p>

      <td width="50%" valign="top" align="left">Here's the first look at the playfield after its been entirely
        stripped and cleaned.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <p>A number of playfield inserts had sunk and I decided to reseat them
        all.&nbsp; So I did the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>used a hair dryer to heat up and loosen the glue around the insert.&nbsp; I
            was able to direct heat to the top and bottom of the playfield.</li>
          <li>I used an extension and a socket just smaller than the
            diameter of the insert.&nbsp;&nbsp; I heated the surrounding glue and
            gradually pushed the insert up from the bottom with one hand.  At the same
            time I gently applied pressure down on the insert with my other hand from the 
            top.&nbsp; This way the insert came out slowly and didn't tear up
            the playfield veneer edges.</li>
          <li>I cleaned up and polished each insert with Novus 1 and reapplied
            the black insert outline with a Testors paint pen.</li>
          <li>Each insert hole also had it's black outline touched up with a
            Testor's paint pen.</li>
          <li>The inserts were glued back in place using the thick gel super glue.&nbsp; I 
            placed a small block of wood on top of the playfield
            and push the insert up from the bottom until it met the block.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It may of been overkill to reseat every playfield insert, but the
        playfield is as flat as can be and besides that's what a project like
        this is all about - it was fun.

   <tr>
      <td width="50%" valign="top">
        <p>The backglass had some problems with paint flaking.  This is a common problem with a backglass this age and is typically
           the result humidity and/or tempature changes.  The glass and it's painted image expand and contract at different rates.  Overtime this
           causes the paint to lift and start flaking away.  Anytime I get "new" old pin, the backglass is the first to be brought into the house.  It's kept in an air conditioned constant tempature environment.</p>
           For the most part, the backglass is in good shape.  There were a number of areas where the
           paint was flaking, but an application of Krylon Triple Thick did the trick.  Using the Krylon product, spray left to right and then top to bottom.  Use your
           judgement, but don't apply too much.  Especially around the score windows because you'll be removing the Krylon product with a razor and
           don't want too much of an edge to show.  Also, before applying Krylon Triple Thick, clean the score windows and credit window with a Qtip and Windex.  For
           more details on this topic be sure to visit Clay's <A HREF="http://marvin3m.com/restore/index.htm"> restoration guide.</A> 

        <p>Backglass paint touch ups are done after the application of Krylon Triple Thick.  I was lucky the paint flaking was limited to black non translucent areas.  Because it was non translucent (i.e. no light bulb to show from behind) I was able
           to use a black Testors paint pen.  It matched well and the pen made it easy to apply a number of coats of paint.  There was one turquoise translucent 
           area to also touch up.  I'm happy with the results, but paint matching is an art in itself and takes lots of practice.</P>
        <p>Although not shown in this picture, once all paint touch ups are complete, the non translucent areas can be covered with silver acrylic paint to help blend with the rest of the backglass.</p>
