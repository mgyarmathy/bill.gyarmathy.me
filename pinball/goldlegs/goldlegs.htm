<H1>Removing gold anodic coating from pinball legs</H1>

<BR>Some pinball machines come with factory installed "gold" legs.&nbsp; 
These can be found on machines like Indiana Jones, World Cup Soccer 94, Theatre 
of Magic, The Addams Family Gold and others.&nbsp; The process of creating 
"gold" legs is accomplished through the process of <A 
href="http://www.anodizing.org/faqs.html">anodizing</A>.&nbsp; Over time, the anodic coating can get beat up, trashed out and look
bad.&nbsp; To make a 
pin look new again, people usually replace the ratty looking gold legs with new 
ones.&nbsp;<P>Like many pinball collectors, I have a hard time throwing away
parts just because they 
are beat up and looking old.&nbsp; I had some restoration projects that needed
new legs, so I thought why can't I refinish the gold legs and use them.&nbsp;
The idea was to remove the gold finish/coating to show the nice chrome finish
underneath.</P>
<P>To refinish the gold pinball legs I first tried using a <A 
href="http://home.earthlink.net/~billg4me/pinball/spaceodyssey/#buffing">buffing 
wheel</A>, but didn't like the results and it required too much effort.&nbsp; 
Getting a bit frustrated, I turned to <A href="http://groups.google.com/">Google 
Groups</A> and put in the words "remove anodizing".&nbsp; As usual, Google saved 
the day and came up with multiple discussion <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=20021129092233.27595.00003748%40mb-mr.aol.com"> threads</a> on how to remove an 
anodized coating.&nbsp;&nbsp; To my surprise the chemical used is a common house 
hold product.&nbsp; The answer is, drum roll please, oven cleaner!</P>
<P>This guide is put together share the information and tips I gathered while 
using oven cleaner to remove the anodic gold coating from pinball legs.&nbsp; Your 
results may vary, but I found that underneath a beat up set of gold legs is a 
nice an shiny chrome finish.&nbsp; Click on pictures for their full image.</P>

            <P>Before applying the oven cleaner, choose a work area that's well ventilated.&nbsp; A shady spot under a tree would be
            best.&nbsp; The shade is helpful in keeping the oven cleaner from drying
            out.&nbsp; I also used a sheet of plywood and covered it with a sheet or
            two of newspaper.&nbsp; This makes for easy cleanup
            afterwards.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
            <P>The leg doesn't require much preparation before spraying it with
            oven cleaner.&nbsp; Just make sure it's somewhat clean so the
            oven cleaner can soak in and do its work&nbsp; I first sprayed the
            inside of the leg, turned it over, and then sprayed the outside and
            bottom.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
            <P>Leave the cleaner on for a good hour.&nbsp; Next, check how the
            cleaner is working by wiping an area of the leg with some
            newspaper.&nbsp; You should see a nice clean chrome finish
            underneath.&nbsp; Some of the surface rust was even removed.&nbsp; Clean up the rest of the leg by wiping
            off the cleaner
            with more newspaper.&nbsp; Once the cleaner has been removed, rinse
            with some soapy water.&nbsp; Wipe the leg dry and let the sun remove
            any remaining moisture.</P>

            <p>After an hour of the oven cleaner doing its job, there were still
